            Thanks to the Shokz OpenSwim headphones, enjoying your favorite
            podcasts while swimming is now more accessible than ever. These
            waterproof, bone-conduction headphones are designed for swimmers who
            want to listen to audio content during their workouts. However,
            since Bluetooth signals don&apos;t transmit well underwater, the
            OpenSwim relies on its built-in MP3 player. This means you&apos;ll
            need to download your podcasts as MP3 files and transfer them to
            your device.
