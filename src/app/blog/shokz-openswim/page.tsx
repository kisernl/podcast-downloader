              Thanks to the Shokz OpenSwim headphones, enjoying your favorite
              podcasts while swimming is now more accessible than ever. These
              waterproof, bone-conduction headphones are designed for swimmers
              who want to listen to audio content during their workouts.
              However, since Bluetooth signals don&apos;t transmit well
              underwater, the OpenSwim relies on its built-in MP3 player. This
              means you&apos;ll need to download your podcasts as MP3 files and
              transfer them to your device.

              To listen to podcasts on your OpenSwim, you&apos;ll first need to
