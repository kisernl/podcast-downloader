## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (set up your own server)
- API keys for Apple Podcasts and/or Podcast Index

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/utlandingur/podcast-downloader.git
   cd podcast-downloader
   ```
2. Install dependencies (currently requires `--force` due to React version conflicts, but this does not seem to cause issues):
   ```sh
   npm install --force
   ```
3. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env.local` file and add:
   ```env
   APPLE_PODCAST_API_KEY=your_apple_api_key
   PODCAST_INDEX_API_KEY=your_podcast_index_api_key
   PODCAST_INDEX_API_SECRET=your_podcast_index_api_secret
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
- Search for podcasts using the search bar.
- Download episodes directly from the interface.
- All fetching and downloading of episodes is done locally on the machine to minimize running costs.

## Development Testing

### Local MongoDB Setup

For local development and testing, you can use MongoDB Community Edition via Homebrew:

1. **Install MongoDB Community Edition**:
   ```sh
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community

2. Start MongoDB service:
brew services start mongodb-community

3. Connect to MongoDB:
```sh
mongosh
> use podcast-downloader-dev
```

4. Stop MongoDB service (when done):
brew services stop mongodb-community

5. Update your .env.local to use local MongoDB:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/podcast-downloader-dev


### Set up environment variables: Create a `.env.local` file and add:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/podcast-downloader-dev
   ```

### Getting API Keys

Podcast Index API (Required for v2/default functionality):

1. Visit https://api.podcastindex.org/ 
2. Copy your PODCAST_INDEX_API_KEY and PODCAST_INDEX_API_SECRET
3. Add these to your .env.local file

add to .env.local
```env
   PODCAST_INDEX_API_KEY=your_podcast_index_api_key
   PODCAST_INDEX_API_SECRET=your_podcast_index_api_secret
```

### Development Authentication

For testing user features (download history, favorites) without Google OAuth setup:

1. The app includes a dev credentials provider that automatically activates in development mode
2. No additional setup required - just run npm run dev
3. In the login dialog, you'll see a "Continue as Dev User" option
4. Dev user email: dev@local.test - automatically created in your local MongoDB
5. Note: You may need to manually refresh the page after dev login to see auth state changes & also after logout

This allows you to test download persistence and user features without configuring Google OAuth credentials.
